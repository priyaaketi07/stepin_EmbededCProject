Introduction

Now a days everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors for comfortness. The Seat Heating System is capable of maintaining of heat of the seats in the vehicles. In some countries, the temperature is very low. In our project, the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then the heater can be turned ON by the driver and he can set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and display will show requested the temperature. In our project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, and display, etc.

Features

- Its capable of determining weather the person is seated in the seat or not.
- If the person is seated in the vehicle it will generate a signal.
- After that the heater get turns ON.
- The person can modify the temperature as required.
- Low cost and robust system.
- Modular Based Programming.

**SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats**

**Strengths**

- User Friendly
- Easy to alter the temperature of the seats in  the vehicles.
- Modular Approach
- Low cost and Robust system.

**Weakness**

- Its only applicable for those areas which are having low temperature.

**Opportunities**

- It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC.

**Threats**

- Not suitable for average or high temperature places.
